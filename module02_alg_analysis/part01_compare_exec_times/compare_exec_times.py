"""
In this week you will implement and test the functions example1 and example3 of p.143 in the GTG book
and test their execution time.
The functions are given, so you should only try to understand their code.
However, the main is not given, so you should implement your own main to test these functions.
Both function take as input a list S (not a dictionary!!!)

What is the Big-Oh complexity of example1 and example3?

    You have to provide the implementation of this function:
    This function tests whether the intersection of the lists A, B, and C is empty.
    It returns the boolean value True if the intersection is empty, and False otherwise.
    Assume that the 3 lists have at most 1 element in common, in case of not empty intersection the function also prints
    the value of the common element and the positions in the 3 lists at which the common element is found:
    Example:
    A = [4, 7, 8, 4], B=[89, 76], C=[6,9,67]
    intersection(A,B,C) returns True
    A = [4, 7, 8, 4], B=[9, 1, 7, 3, 4], C=[56, 33, 7]
